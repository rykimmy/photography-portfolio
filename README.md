## Description

This project is a photography portfolio. As a aspiring software developer as well as a passionate photographer, I sought to merge these interests of mine and use my coding skills to showcase some of my photographs. The portfolio is split into four sections: People, Nature, Sports, and Film, each of which showcases a few of my favorite shots I've taken over the years. I connected my portfolio to a Firebase backend to store these photos as well as their dimensions. This project uses React, HTML, CSS, and Firebase.

To run the code locally, `cd` into the directory and run `npm run dev`.
